### How do I get set up? ###

If you do not have webpack and webpack-dev-server set up, please run:

    npm i webpack webpack-dev-server -g

After that, all you need to do is open up your workspace in the command line and run:

    npm i

### Build (This doesn't require a server to be running)

    npm run build

You can now open the index.html file now and view the application.
